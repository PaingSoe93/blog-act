From meandering here and in the desert Southwest, I have learned that the history of the Indians, and therefo re even the Midwest, is tied to the Spanish, who came south of here and introduced horses and wheat and goats and massive slaughter and disease and eventually the creation of new nations and independent states and countless mission communities and Catholicism.</p><p>He brought us to the Sanchez Romero Grocery Store in a mall near his flat. Spanish wines, sherry, salami, olives, hams, Japanese rice and Mexican tortillas. Chicken, and several cuts of steak which were quite impressive, but nothing next to the selection of local and French cheeses. Pheasants hung upside down and some still bled from their feathers. The raw brains of lambs. Grouse, partridge and skinned rabbits, which bled out of the remains of their eyes and brains. I examined the seafood section - shrimps, crabs, fish, salmon, lobster, eels and tiny barnacles.</p><p>It was strange, but equally impressive that a landlocked city such as Madrid lived on such a high diet of seafood. Very little of this seafood came from Spanish waters. The Mediterranean is essentially a dead sea - fished out from years of over-use. To fish in the Mediterranean today often means illegally dropping bombs to shock 'anything that lives' to the surface,netted and sold dried in Greek and North African fish markets. Ralph explained that if you want tapas in Madrid, there is only one place to go. Soon enough, we were at Bocaito, a small bar packed with chattering Madrileños. Sherry from Jerez, a plate of salted olives, tuna on bread, chorizo sausages, octopus, fried peppers, monkfish liver, shrimps fried in garlic oil. Tapa - the word for 'cover,' comes from the practice of placing a lid over a glass of wine or sherry to keep out the flies - and adding olives or cheese on the lid as a complement to the wine.</p>",

    "body": "<p>The island is unlike your dry, desolate climate.  The cliffs are swollen with clouds of deep green trees, and there are valleys in shades of celadon, moss and apple.  Whatever dreary existence you may have left behind, you see hope ahead.Fast forward 10,000 years, and I am walking in the La Kalsa District of Palermo, capital of a very different island – Sicily, Italy. This is the old Arab quarter of the city, built in the tenth century during an age of Muslim rule.  Here the streets are very narrow, the buildings bruised by time.  Bullets and shrapnel from the Second World War scar the limestone walls, but underneath that are nicks and scratches apparently dating back through most of the ages of civilization.</p><p>There is no continent on Earth where Sicily fails to export its archetypal imagery of a rural and rustic, sun-baked Italy at the heart of the Mediterranean.  Everywhere, in the form of olive oil labels, wine bottles and faded paintings in Italian restaurants, we are showered with visions of an enduring, dry place, an emblem for all pastoral Mediterranean. Before I left for Sicily, friends couldn't help but to ask me the same question as a dozen before them.  Are you going to eat the food?  Are you going to soak up all that Sicilian cuisine?  The persistence of these questions reminded me that most people travel to fulfill something they believe a place satisfies for them.  I don't like this idea; the idea of going to a place to see what you already know of it.  Or of going somewhere simply to eat; gorging on its authenticity.  I decided I needed to travel to Sicily on a blank slate; to just ignore all those things I think I know about it and the things that other people tell me are important about it.</p><p>That's how I ended up here in this tangle of walkways, too narrow for the smallest three-wheeled Italian trucks.  I walk into a café for something to eat.  Two men are at the counter and a third is making a coffee.  Coffee is an understatement – Sicilians love to cram a thick pasty liquid caffeine into a cup fit for a squirrel.  The café is lit by bare bulbs, the interior is painted gray.  A wall calendar in Arabic, unopened packages lined against the wall, a single dying plant in the window. The men all turn around when I walk in. I ask them about the story on the cover of all the Sicilian newspapers – photos of overcrowded deportation centers, rafts overloaded with dark-skinned men, women, children, angry protesters waving flags,  ships spilling with humans, surrounded by military Zodiacs, and photos of dead bodies lined up on beaches.</p><p>Usually, they believe something very specific will happen to the world – a comet, asteroids, solar flares, the Yellowstone super volcano, American debt, global financial collapse.  In almost every case, the world ends for very implausible reasons; the types of reasons men of science would never worry about.  In most cases, the obsession of the prepper revolves around security, because to many preppers, the ultimate threat you will face in the end days is the inevitability of others attacking you for your stores of food and water. They put up gates, they set traps, they blockade their perimeter.  And most of all, they stockpile weapons. While most preppers seem to have this weird obsession with defense, others place their priorities on what's called a 'bug-out bag.' Bug-out bag: backpack that contains everything you would need to survive a short amount of time in the event of a disaster.  Many who live in earthquake, tsunami or tornado zones also quite rationally build a bug-out bag; but we're talking about bug-out bags to survive the end of the world.</p>",

    "title": "Majesty of Lisbon's Alfama",
    "body": "<p>Lisbon feels tropical, connected to Africa, on a biting cold day, and in its southern sun, like a mix and match of its neighbor’s architectures. It is colored in a smudgy gray, festooned with pinks and canaries and aquas and limes. Its slight inhabitants dress urbanely like their country cousins; just in tighter weaves. Over lunch a long time ago with a Portuguese friend, I came up with the idea of hosting a Portuguese Empire party; literally a party themed on Portugal's historical colonial empire. Let's forget for brevity its success or outcome. I came up with this idea with only the faintest notion of what Portugal is, or was. Perhaps it was subconsciously strategic that the two food critics at my old school newspaper were both Portuguese, and that sure, they'd love to help and do the cooking. My Portugal, the one I imagined in preparing for my party, turned from a whim into a dream. Portugal was a place whose territories occupied the strangest realms of the world: the places where other countries failed to show interest or failed to see any worth. As the sea race to control trade with India and the Spice Islands heated up over the centuries, Portugal's dominance of the seas dwindled to a secondary power, and yet they still coaxed a fair portion of the world into their grasp. The Portuguese world was a sleepy backwater; multilingual, steamy, a dozen lands and a thousand islands.</p><p>In 1755, an Earthquake rumbled in Portugal's Algarve lands to the south. Half the city collapsed and fifteen thousand perished. Much of Lisbon's history fell with the Earthquake. Except one area. Before the earthquake, this area, the Alfama District, was the hottest wealthy neighborhood in Portugal. Hip and wealthy, it also carried a Moorish architectural past.Roman and Arab are literally painted and constructed on top of and over each other, making the whole place a mash of centuries.Portuguese Empire myth came from music: Cesaria Evora and Jobim and others. Music that was a dialogue of other times. It is a surprise then to learn that the Alfama also continues to be a center for that old Portuguese-style blues; the fado. And even with the pattering of rain, you can hear some old man crooning or a guitarre picking behind some alley or courtyard. The rain is pouring heavily now, and we're treading along the streets to the Alfama District. We stop in a small cafe - there seem to be thousands of such cafes in this city - and we share a coffee and a bowl of fruit.</p><p>When Jane and I stepped into Lisbon, I stepped into my Portuguese Empire. Lisbon really is that cobbled city of my imagination, and the Alfama, being the last standing of old Lisbon, is the epitomy of my imagined Portuguese Empire. Portuguese author Jose Saramago calls the Alfama a 'mythological beast' and continues to explain that he, nor anyone else can exactly know what it is. For what it's worth, the Alfama is a labyrinth of dark, wet alleys. Of old richly embellished tiles that facade entire exteriors. It is most of all a labryinth of Lisbon's history, set upon a glimpse of urban Lisbon lifestyles. For the Alfama is residential, with few specific tourist stops. We walk slowly. The doors of apartments feature old bronzework of dragons and beasts. Scratched paint shows dozens of layers beneath each wall. For people who like history without walking through old churches and museums, the Alfama is a mood piece of a hundred eras. A glimpse of the faded majesty of the Portuguese Empire.</p><p>The first problem that planning this party involved was finding out what the Portuguese Empire was, and how to cook in the styles of each of Portugal's colonial territories. The island of Cape Verde, off the coast of Western Africa. Goa, in Western India. Ceylon, now Sri Lanka. Brazil. Mozambique. Macau. Portugal focused its territorial expansion on the Atlantic by the thirteenth century; they were one of the earliest masters of the high seas, and used it to their benefit. From Vasco de Gama to Magellan and beyond, Portuguese sailors literally connected the world by sea. Over time, modern politics and economic realities shrunk Portugal's overseas colonies. In 1999, Portugal turned over its last far-flung colony, Macau, to China. All of the shapes and colors of old Portugal seem to still exist here. And the colors of places from the other side of the world As if I would know. Perhaps, it is my imagination - created all those years ago in a crowded apartment in Los Angeles.</p>",

    "body": "<p>The seedy pirate-town architecture still stands, although cropped against plenty of surf shops and trendy retailers. Today, Tarifa is a rather hip neo-Bohemian town. And surfboards are for sale everywhere. But where are the waves? An old unshaven Swede says otherwise. The kite-surf and wind-surf capital of the world, yes, maybe, but small waves. Johann moved from Sweden to Marbella, a coastal area of endless high-rises to the east of here, but admits,  I was too drunk to drive home so this hotel is my second.I came to Marbella and Tarifa because it is primitive, you know? You buy a fish and it is not a fancy fish like in Stockholm. It is not delicate, but it is just caught and it is primitively prepared. I love the primitive preparation and the primitive womens. I love those Moroccan womens in their djebellas.I tell him of my route with Jane, how we are collecting artisanal cheeses, and of Extremadura, the province north of here which has almost no value to the casual tourist, and plenty of value to anybody who loves agricultural landscapes, and cheese. I say, you know that in Spain there are about thirty-five different types of sheep. And each of those produces a different type of milk.</p><p>Jane and I leave the next morning, ascending the coastal Bermeja mountains, until our lawnmower-car is putting along a road between wind-sharpened rocks, lichen and foggy meadows. When we descend toward the city of Ronda, we are in the heart of Andalucía.Much of Andalucía is the sun-baked watershed of the Rio Guadalquivar Basin, the same river that Columbus and Magellan sailed from. It would appear in the dry-season a moonscape, although brighter, almost yellow. The rolling empty is punctuated by old farming estates, many of which are buildings of incredible beauty. Some have viewing towers, and even others are outlined in tiles or mosaics in the colors of ochre, blue and brick red. The interior of Andalucía is solely responsible for all the fantastical images we have of Spain, and in spite of this, much of the small roads of this interior are almost unknown to the outside world. The Spaghetti Westerns were filmed here, because this desert-like landscape resembles our imagination of New Mexico and Arizona two hundred years ago. And the prickly-pear cactuses help that image. They were brought back on Columbus’ ships, and felt at home.</p><p>We read from our imaginary book about traveling in pursuit of artisanal cheese. Montclair, our make-believe expert on all matters of cheese travel, was adamant about the value of history to appreciating cheese. He mentioned Ronda as ‘one of the last beacons of the Muslim world in Europe.’Jane and I are crossing through the western Andalucian interior the slow way, taking our time and avoiding the larger cities. Our rented car is shorter than a mini, nearly as ugly as a Citron, and sounds like a vacuum cleaner at high speeds.Ronda is a city on a limestone bulwark. A castle of steep rock. In the middle ages, as the Christians advanced on the Moorish land, Ronda was almost the last to fall.</p><p>Overnighting on a chain of small towns, we eventually make our way to the isolated Sierra de Aracena. All these roads, and Jane seems to humor herself by giving commentary on the world outside. Of two pigs copulating, she mumbles ‘pig porno’, of sheep grazing, ‘dirty!’ and of a goat with a long beard, ‘Gandalf’ We rest for the night in the small town of Aracena, high up enough to be cooler than the rest of Andalucía. It is white-washed, and upon its highest hill is an old Roman ruins, and a Catholic church in its shadow. Everybody, it would seem, eats the cured hams from these mountains. A breed of black-hooved and black-skinned hogs are raised in these mountains, and feed solely on the plentiful acorns which sometimes seem to carpet the entire landscape. They are free-range hogs – imagine that, and seem almost happy. In Andalucía , this jamon is often paired with cheese. They are both simple foods, as is most of Spanish cuisine, and celebrated for their many levels of complexity. The way some people sniff at their glass of red wines, the Andalucíans revel in the complexity of their small dishes of simple foods. We walk up and down the narrow streets of Aracena at night, talking about friends back home. When we pause to photograph an alley, an old woman peers at us from her doorway.</p>",

    "body": "<p>Other travel writers seem to be doing it all the time, following the routes of their favorite icon or explorer.  But after agreeing to a lifelong journey, we found that the subject of our travels simply didn't exist.  And so we invented him – an imaginary guide whose wisdom exceeds that of every other travel writer's muse. Jane and I carry our sleeping son to a restaurant in a small alpine town in the Allgäu region of Bavaria.  This is a favorite of my parents, and a chance for them to show it to Jane's mom in the few days we have left before fifty friends and family converge here. My family orders all the specialties of this restaurant – deer and local lake fish.  But I haven't the appetite for the hearty Bavarian restaurant faire.  Instead, I look for the plate that most resembles what Bavarians eat at home – a simple plate of bread and cheese. The right fromage, caseophiles might say, requires a perfect pairing of the appropriate wine.  In Bavaria, and for this particular cheese, however, the perfect wine is a beer.  A pils in a tall glass.</p><p>Bavarian cheese is a product of the Roman Empire, like most of the famous cheeses of the world.  The Romans did not invent cheese, but they instituted the methods that would pave the way for the most famous cheeses of the world.  What separates Bavarian cheeses, or, high mountain cheeses of the northern alps, from other cheeses, is climate: these cheeses didn't need the high salt content of cheeses from the warmer weather of Southern Europe. An Alpen cheese, then, is less about salt, and more about the taste of the plants ingested by the cheese-producing animal.  Bergkäse has a nutty, rich flavor.  It is mild but with a nice complexity that fits a good beer well. A European fromager by trade, Montclair left his post at a fine urban Fromagerie later in life, for what he called The Constellation Gallia. Although history has buried Montclair's actual nationality, we know, based on his imaginary journals in English and French, that he was, as a man and a traveler, entirely a product of the Enlightenment. </p><p>Montclair's Constellation Gallia was itself an Enlightenment allegory.  What he meant is that he saw each cheese-producing town as a bright light, like a star.  And so, looking down on the Old World, you would see the brightest stars of the constellation as places like the Pyrenées, Savoie, or Emilia-Romagna, where production of the world’s finest cheeses is concentrated. Montclair's window of opportunity to enter into Bavaria would have been around the year 1925. As a child of the age of the Enlightenment, Montclair would have been very conscious of the German contribution to the age that created the modern world.  Although the Enlightenment's earliest ideas sifted throughout Western Europe and New England, its earliest shoots were German. Today, we see Immanuel Kant as the instigator of this age of reason. </p><p>Montclair took Kant’s words to heart.  “Happiness is not an ideal of reason but of imagination,” Kant had written in 1785.  As a successful fromager with big city connections, Montclair had all the access to what people defined as happiness.  But at some point in his life, he realized that the collections of furniture and paintings yielded no such happiness. The more you own, Montclair realized, the less you have.  The more you live, the more you love, the more you taste – this is surely what Kant meant.  Leave it all behind – walk out that door. The Great War would have eliminated any possibility for a man like Montclair to near the German border, but by 1925, the country had miraculously recovered its Enlightenment roots.  This was the Germany that was, in Montclair's mind, the end product of the Enlightenment: industriousness alongside art and architecture.  Science alongside poetry.  Dance and jazz and coffeehouses.  Progressive, liberal Democracy alongside a renewed interest in preserving the rich fabric of Germany's past. Those were the elements that would have made entry into Germany possible.  But that was Kant's Germany, which, technically, was a very different Germany: the Germany north of the Rhein. The Germany that interested Montclair, naturally, would have been the part that was brightest on his constellation.  The Germany of mountains and foothills and rolling grazing lands – Bavaria and the alps. </p>",

    "title": "The Barbary Macaques of Gibraltar",
    "body": "<p>Some have more unusual explanations. In 1920, a journalist for the London Daily Mail wrote, Well-known monkeys are absent for months, and then reappear with new, strange, adult monkeys of a similar breed. Those who know Gibraltar will agree that there is not a square yard on the Rock where they could have hidden. The author insisted that the only explanation was a submarine tunnel underneath the Mediterranean, connecting the African dens to Gibraltar. As Gibraltar is simply a large rock (two square miles of Jurassic limestone) - a British colony on the Southern tip of the Iberian Peninsula - everybody, the monkeys included, are in close proximity. Squished together, hugging the steep cliffsides. The monkeys have hands remarkably like humans, but their behavior is much more monkeylike. 'You think their hands would be rough like dog paws,' Jane says. 'But it's like holding a human hand. They are like baby hands.' Ernest invites us to his shaded hut. His accent is more international than the other Gibraltarians we meet. Their English is perhaps the strangest on Earth, sounding sinister, Cockney and Spanish, Arabic and cartoonish all at once. </p><p>Ernest gives his own explanation for the origin of the monkeys, They were brought over here in the year 1311 by Arabs. This was an outpost for them at the time. In 1704, when the British first came to Gibraltar, there were only 11 or 12 monkeys on the peninsula. The British Consul wanted to increase their number. Slowly they were cared for and reared by the military. Caring for the monkeys is not all tourism and show. It is perhaps vital for the people of Gibraltar. Spain - which itself stubbornly refuses to give up its stake in two chunks of the Moroccan mainland, insists that Gibraltar is rightfully Spanish. In two weeks, our foreign ministers are meeting. The foreign minister of Britain is going to Spain and they are expected to make some progress on the subject of our sovereignty. The thing is that we want to be at peace with the Spanish. If the British ever leave, we don't want to go to Spain. We want to be our own people. We will not be ruled by Spain! We are our own nationality. Everybody on Gibraltar believes in our autonomy. We like the British but if they leave we want to be a sovereign state.</p><p>This myth has existed since the Spanish began making a series of military bungles against the British on the Rock in an attempt to seize what they could never keep even from the Moors. The Spanish finally resorted to the statement that when the monkeys perish, the British will lose Gibraltar. When the ape population dwindled to about seven individuals near the end of World War II, Sir Winston Churchhill ordered a replenishment from Morocco. In a speech, he said that Gibraltar will remain British as long as the apes shall live.</p><p>Ernest pauses to fumble with his pack of Dunhill Filters. His perch is a small painted shack. Like all the rest of Gibraltar's human community below us, it is compact and built tightly against the cliff. His view is the best in all of Gibraltar - a view of a great harbor, a city and the Iberian mainland beyond. It is glorious and vaguely tropical. To his back is Africa, to his front the nation that wants him speaking Spanish. It's a big responsibility. Gibraltar was an essential military component in the defense against Napolean. It is thought that without its strategic location, the British Isles would now be French. It was important even in the Falkland's War. So important that the Argentines attempted to blow the whole harbor up by sneaking bomb-clad divers into Spain. When all England's Falkland ships would be refueling in port, the diver's would slip into the sea, creating Pearl Harbor II. Spain uncovered and foiled the plot. Gibraltar was known in Roman times, along with a mountain on the African coast - called back then the Mountain of Apes - as the physical end of the world. Beyond these Straits of Gibraltar swam the dragons and demons of the Atlantic.</p>",

    "body": "<p>That moment of sending your kid off into the unknown, is terrifying, but once he and his carry-on have disappeared around the corner, it’s no longer fear, but  a completely new sensation. Maybe this is a taste of how parents feel after sending their kid off to college - that deep, unsettling feel of, huh, what now? A school-parent friend once told me that I had been dubbed Ghost Dad, never showing up for drop-off or pick-up.  But now was my time to make up for six years of absence; I could finally get to know the parents, all holed up together in a downtown Mérida hotel. I told the parents that in the morning, I would be heading just outside the northwest perimeter of Mérida, where there were some wetlands and open meadows. Would you join me? </p><p>Not much of a response comes through on our messaging app, and none of the dads show up at the taxi the next morning. I wonder: maybe I didn’t sell that well enough?  I had almost told them that this would be the most memorable day of their entire trip.  But I held back, not being able to promise that at all. In fact, I would be winging everything; bumbling tour guide to a place I’ve never been. My taxi driver, who had insisted I didn’t really want to go to the place I insist on going, gives up and drops me off on a quiet street near the Kai Luum ecological area.  How will you even get back? He had asked. Maybe you'll pick me up? Almost instantly as I walk into the bounds of the park, life is everywhere: Malachite butterflies, dainty wildflowers, and fluorescent-colored Painted Buntings. After roaming the park for a few hours on my own, I am approached by the only other man in the park, Jorge, who has been honing his photography skills in Yucatán’s natural areas each weekend. We introduce ourselves, and then Jorge explains that there is a lagoon just a kilometer away.  I tell him that I didn’t remember another body of water around here. He insists that due to its large size, there is much more wildlife there.</p><p>I agree to join him, and hop in his car.  After we pass the kilometer mark, he tells me that the lagoon is just a few more kilometers away. We pull into the parking lot of a new apartment building, and park discreetly at the corner of the property.  In front of us is a sign: Propiedad Privada No Traspasando. We navigate under the sharp cow fence, and walk down a rocky and abandoned road.  When we get to the lagoon, it is almost completely devoid of life, unlike the nearby Kai Luum park. Jorge insists that he has been to this place many times, and we should walk around the lagoon.  There may even be Yucatán Jays, he explains. We walk on an overgrown trail around the lagoon, looking for what is surely Southern Mexico’s most beautiful bird.  But the sun is beating down on a windless day, and it’s getting closer to noon; that classic combination that makes wildlife disappear. </p><p>I follow Jorge toward the other side of the lagoon.  Nothing there. We start to head back to the car, and I remember the promise I held back from the dads: It’ll be your best day in Mexico! Jorge says, “let’s try down here.”  Again, we walk down a new overgrown trail, heading into lagoon-side dry forest.  There they are, six Yucatán Jays: jet black heads, yellow eye-rings, azure blue wings, long slender tails.  They are moving as a tribe through the trees, their wingbeats flashes of brilliant blue. Instantly, the day feels glorious. After Jorge drops me off at the ecological park, a text comes through from one of the parents.  “Haven’t heard or seen much from you in the last twenty-four hours.” He kindly invites me to join up with the group. I want to break my reputation as Ghost Dad, but at the same time, I had just answered my question - huh, what now? - and arrange with the taxi driver to leave Mérida entirely, heading west to the Yucatán state’s northwest coast. Coastal wetlands have not one, but many scents; the smell of salt-soaked mud, drying algae, hydrogen sulfide,  sweet spring blossoms, the fishy smell of decaying aquatic creatures. Some mangrove smells are pleasant, others are not, but I enjoy them equally.  Together they evoke a sundrenched memory, tied not to one place, but to a mysterious habitat type that wraps around the world’s intertropical latitudes.</p>",

    "title": "Primeval and Protected Osa Peninsula",
    "body": "<p>I can’t help to think about the book I just read while peering at the green mountains of the Osa Peninsula. My copy of Half Earth, by Edward O. Wilson, arrived coincidentally just before my family was to jet off to the southwestern end of Costa Rica. In Half Earth, Edward O. Wilson argues that in order to preserve our biosphere, we should consider the goal of setting aside at least half of Earth’s land and oceans: that now is the time for governments and private conservation organizations to begin patching together the smaller pieces of protected land into large, unbroken continental preserves, and for governments to agree on setting large sections of ocean into permanently protected zones.</p><p>The Osa Peninsula, one of the most protected regions in the American tropics, makes a great place to think about the ideas in Wilson’s Half Earth.  For one, nearly the entire Peninsula has some degree of protection.  And at the center of this protection is the crown jewel of Costa Rica’s national park system; Corcovado National Park.  There are many similarities between the way the Osa Peninsula is protected, versus the way much of the rest of Costa Rica is protected.  And these differences mimic many of the arguments made by Wilson in Half Earth. On the approach to Puerto Jimenez, population 1,800,  I see a complex coastline of isolated beaches, dense mangroves, twisty rivers, meadows, ranches, turquoise salt flats, small clusters of lonely sailboats.  A Southern Lapwing takes flight from a palm that has bent downward into the water.  No three-story buildings, no billboards.  Just wild land and a small cluster of dusty streets and an airstrip. I’ve seen my share of the tropical Americas from the sky; tell me no more, it takes just a second to know heaven on Earth. The Cessna takes a deep dive, it’s a short runway, and, according to the pilot about the trees on the approach, ‘they keep getting taller and taller every year!' There is only one other airplane on the runway - a Cessna 4-seater.  The pilot of this plane hands our luggage to the pilot of the other plane, ushers us out, and then takes off again.  A few minutes later, we are in the air again.  This time, overland across cliffs draped in blooming trees.</p><p>Ahead is a small runway carved out of the forest, between a Pacific coast beach and a steep, jungly cliff. This is Carate, formerly the airstrip for foreign gold-mining operations that once swelled this coastline with a population of 60,000.  The creation of the national park forced the end of gold mining operations in the Osa Peninsula, and now there is just an airstrip, a convenience store, two lodges and a handful of homes. My son, who has learned in the Spanish language since kindergarten, has never spoken the language outside of the classroom, and has been openly questioning why he can’t learn in English, like every other kid. But hearing our driver, who’s waiting for us at the airstrip, seems to pique his interest. As we drive into the hills to our destination - Luna Lodge - something seems to snap into place.  He, not us, understands our driver.  We are in his 8-year old hands.  For the first time in our lives, we depend on him. Over the course of our stay, he will meet a variety of Spanish-speaking kids, all of whom seem as equally transfixed as my son with the lodge’s mascot dog.  One of the Spanish-speaking kids explains to me the source of the dog’s visible scars.</p><p>Later, another kid explains:  “You see those scars on Osa? She was in the woods, chasing after a bird, but a pack of howler monkeys didn’t like that she was in their jungle, and they beat her up!' On a cloudy afternoon, I take a walk with Kevin, one of the lodge guides. A steep road, cut into a steep hillside; makes for complex geography and varied habitats: dense viney jungle, steep cliffs and river gorges.  We are looking for Orange-collared Manakins, and so we diverge from the road into the forest. We perch ourselves quietly on a hill, and I ask Kevin about which of the stories about Osa’s wounds is true.  “Osa was asleep under the lodge porch,” he explains.  “One of the guides found her struggling, almost dead.  A huge boa constrictor had completely wrapped itself around her, and was biting her in two different places.”  He pointed to his stomach and leg.</p>",

    "body": "<p>I am drawn to places that pulsate with life, and this western perimeter of the Amazon Basin, this wild network of Amazon tributaries which form at the eastern edge of the Andes, is ground zero for biodiversity on Earth. I am hopping a network of three lodges to the Tambopata Research Center, six hours upstream from the port near Puerto Maldonado. I hope to ask, and maybe even answer, some questions about the meaning of places that contain mega-biodiversity. What does it really mean, and why is biodiversity important? From the Refugio Amazonas lodge, about two hours upriver, I walk down a small path with a handful of tourists, guides and naturalists, and step onto a riverboat. It's been raining upriver, at the river's origins in Bolivia, and in the isolated and nearly uninhabited protected zones to the south. That means the riverboat pilot, who communicates with the captain from the front, needs to be extraordinarily vigilant; the river is already raging, and islands of logs are rushing downriver.</p><p>I ask Saay, who I hired as a jungle guide under contract with Rainforest Expeditions, about the Ceiba tree to the right of the river. At nearly 200 feet, the tree towers above the rest of the rainforest canopy. The trunks of ceiba trees rise straight up without branches, and form a grand umbrella, providing imposing shade beneath. In the darkness of the tree's upper limbs, you can make out a silhouette of orchids, heliconias, oropendola nests and vines. It is deep in the shadows of this umbrella that Peruvian tribes imagined Gods to dwell. Hearing Saay's reply, a jungle tourist in the seats ahead of us turns around. Clifton is wearing a khaki shirt, sport sunglasses bound by Croakies, and technical pants that zip off into shorts.</p><p>It's going to be a long trip upriver, so I put my feet up and rest my binoculars on my lap, and looking out into the jungle, I sleepily imagine a tribe of 200-foot tall giraffes; double the length of an adult Blue Whale, wandering carelessly along the banks of Amazonia. It is in this sleepy state that, in my head, the sepia and ochre hues of those imaginary giraffes give off both numbers and letters. I perceive the giraffe kind of like this: 13-26-13-26-13-26-13-26, as well as HD, HD, HD, and so on and so forth, all the way down the length of that ceiba tree. For most of my life, I had thought that this way of seeing the world was how everybody else saw it. About a year ago, I was driving west back home in Oregon, and an NPR interview was playing on the radio. The interview subject described this condition that affects about one in a hundred people.</p><p>I slammed on the brakes and pulled into a gas station. Into my phone, I typed a phrase and found the definition of synesthesia, and suddenly I understood something about how I have perceived the world my entire life. Synesthesia comes in many forms. To some people, sounds have taste, or musical notes have color, and others perceive points in time as floating in space. For as long as I remember, numbers and letters emanate color, and words are like little palettes of paint, dates, weekdays and months have hues. Regardless, in anybody who has synesthesia, there is a level of mental crossover, or union, between our senses. Today, I understand the power of my synesthesia on my travel to the Peruvian Amazon, and how it influences the way I see this place. We stop at a small river island to look for macaws. Saay notices river water flooding gently onto the island, and suggests we just leave our boots on the boat. We cross the muddy island with a group of jungle tourists, many who have come all this way just to see the extravagant birds. But as we approach the other side of the island, I get this feeling that the entire island will soon be underwater. Saay and I bird the clay licks in our bare feet, the river water pooling at our feet, while others, in their boots, are forced further and further back.</p>",

    "body": "<p>Under darkness, Carlos and Pablo paddle to a narrow opening in the flooded forest that surrounds the lake.  This is one of the three labyrinthine black rivers on the lodge's 5,000 acre preserve. This preserve lies only a few miles from Yasuni National Park, one of a handful of candidates for the most biodiverse place on Earth.  But you wouldn’t know it, from the way it looks around here, especially in the dark.  All I see are dark shadows of buttressed trees, and vines hanging over the water.  No floral bouquets, no brightly colored macaws resting on tree stumps, and no wily-eyed puma, staring back at us. From the sky, the Amazon will look flat, and its only geographic markers are often the twisty bands of rivers cutting through.  But the Amazon has many unique geographies and habitats, and this particular habitat is blackwater swamp, slow moving water darkened like tea, but clear, with the tannins of decaying vegetation. </p><p>A flash blasts through the narrow river.  Too dark out to show any color, too fast to see.  Just a suggestion, an invisible paint-stroke across the black light.  It’s a kingfisher, awake early to hunt for fish.  Everything here is like that.  It’s there, you just can’t see it.  I leave my underwater video camera in the black, empty water.  When I retrieve it to watch the footage, I know that the water is alive with fish.  It’s there, it’s everywhere, and its alive, this whole place is crawling with life. Although Pablo and I have learned to communicate well, despite our language barriers, sometimes, when I ask him about his children, or his wife, he looks at me blankly and then says, “No, I think it is a Green-and-rufous Kingfisher.”  And when I ask him about the local food in Coca, he might say, “That was a Black-capped Donacobius along the riverbank.” The Amazon Rainforest itself was formed a really, really long time ago, during the Eocene Era, which means that about fifty million years ago, the plates that separated South America and Africa were widening, which meant that a flow of moist Atlantic air encouraged the growth of moist forests along the Atlantic coast of South America. Most ecosystems around the world are in many ways much, much newer than the one in which we are now.  We might describe the Cabo Pulmo coral reef off the Baja Peninsula as the oldest coral reef in North America.  But you know what?, The reef is only twenty-thousand years old!</p><p>But the Amazon, and particularly this part of the Amazon, the eastern third of Ecuador known as the Ecuadorian Oriente, has always remained one of the least impacted places by the climatic events of the past – the geography and weather patterns of time have protected the Oriente from the shifting climates of the rest of the world.  In fact, some scientists believe the Oriente, with a more static climate over millions of years, has seeded the rest of the Amazon over and over again as other parts of the Amazon felt the impacts of time. Climate changes certainly produce new life forms, and changes the face of the Earth.  In that way, biodiversity is dynamic.  But rapid climatic events, or rather, any rapid event on Earth also means mass extinctions.  So, it can take the Earth’s biodiversity 30 million years to recover from an extinction event.  Can you imagine, then, how vital a place like this is?  It’s like a natural seedbank for the Amazon, over the millennia. At the end of the navigable portion of the river, where a striated heron fishes quietly, we depart the boat. Up a hill, along a path, I notice that while the biodiversity is almost completely hidden, it appears in the most hidden nooks and crannies.  Leaves are folded over.  Leaves are sewn together.  Branches and sticks are not always what they seem.  But you can be there, right in front of them, and you don’t see that its not a stick at all, but a lizard, a spider, an orchid vine.</p><p>For the next three hours, we travel on a narrow path through the wet forest, combing the leaf litter for poison frogs.  Seeing something so small, but painted so vividly is a shock to the senses.  Normally, the lower you go toward the ground, the more the tendency is for animal color to dissolve into the darkest and dimmest browns and slates. And then, when we see an aquatic coral snake sliding down a slope, the pattern emerges again – if you’re dangerous on the forest floor, you may have some adaptive advantages that you to tend toward brightness.</p>",
